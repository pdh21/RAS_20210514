### XID+SED: Probabilistic Deblender for Herschel
XID+ developed as part of HELP, now being extended with SED fitting

### Emulating Cigale
Use a multi input, multi output deepnet model, written in JAX

### Fitting Extreme Starburst Candidates
show original map
show replicated maps for both me and Michael's


### Comparing the models
Show Bayesian P value maps


### Taking it to the limit
Inferring hierarchical relations directly on map e.g. SFR vs redshift relation


### Conclusions
* Probabilistic Programming enables us to build and **infer** more complex probabilistic models
* Probabilistic models enables us to combine data with our own expertise
* Traditional data products are a lossy data compression for Herschel
* An alternative interpretation for many of the Extreme Starburst candidates
