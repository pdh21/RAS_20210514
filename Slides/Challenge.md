# Herschel: Informative and confusing


## What Herschel gives us
e.g. FIR measurements, dust, SFR, hogh redshift, wide surveys etc

## The challenge: 
e.g. source confusion, resolution

## Interpretation
limitation of specific data products, e.g. blind catalogues, extreme starformation

## How do we overcome?
Given there isnt a FIR facility planned in the mid-future, and althouhg ALMA, SCUBa2, they do not cover the kind of area we have Herschel data for
we still need to make use of Herschel data,
