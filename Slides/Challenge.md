* $>$ 1270 deg.$^2$, accessible via [HELP](www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk) (Data release today!)
* No planned successor

Note:
* about half of starlight is absorbed by dust, radiating at infrared wavelengths
* redshift
* mix of depths, small, deep fields, large and shallow providing better statistics on rare objects to test galaxy formation scenarios in more detail.
* with no planned successor in fir, we are going to have to rely on Herschel for FIR.

### Assigning flux to sources

|      | Blind                          | Prior driven                       |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pros | Detects all bright sources     | Distributes flux to known galaxies |
| Cons | Need to assign flux to sources | Miss unknown sources               |

Data Products are part of Data Model

Note:
Normal source extraction won't work
Don't know what or how much source contributes to FIR blob
Solution is to do list driven approach
use prior information to build data model, infer model on maps
Wrong model = wrong results = wrong interpretation


Interesting objects from blind catalogues,

Note:
Focus has been on objects with high flux (e.g. for Lenses >100mJy). Confirmed with follow up. There are thousands of other sources in the map.
e.g. A hyperluminous obscured quasar at z=4.3 Efstathiou et al. 2021.
Can we re-examine these extreme starbursts, using prior information to ascertain whether the interpreation holds, or if the blind catalogues problematic in this scenario
