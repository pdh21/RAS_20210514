* $>$ 1270 deg.$^2$, accessible via [HELP](www.herschel.sussex.ac.uk) (Data release today!)
* No planned successor

Note:
* about half of starlight is absorbed by dust, radiating at infrared wavelengths
* redshift
* mix of depths, small, deep fields, large and shallow providing better statistics on rare objects to test galaxy formation scenarios in more detail.
* with no planned successor in fir, we are going to have to rely on Herschel for FIR.

### Assigning flux to sources

|      | Blind                          | Prior driven                       |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pros | Detects all bright sources     | Distributes flux to known galaxies |
| Cons | Need to assign flux to sources | Miss unknown sources               |

Remember: Data Products are part of Data Model

Note:
* Normal source extraction won't work
* Don't know what or how much source contributes to FIR blob
* Solution is to do list driven approach
* use prior information to build data model, infer model on maps
Wrong model = wrong results = wrong interpretation

Interesting objects from blind catalogues, e.g 
<sub><sub>
* **High redshift starbursts** e.g. Riechers et al. 2013
* **Lenses** e.g. Wardlow et al. 2013, Nayyeri et al. 2016, Negrello et al. 2017
* **extreme starbursts**  e.g. Rowan Robinson et al. 2018

Note:
Focus has been on objects with high flux (e.g. for Lenses >100mJy). Confirmed with follow up. There are thousands of other sources in the map.
e.g. A hyperluminous obscured quasar at z=4.3 Efstathiou et al. 2021.
Can we re-examine these extreme starbursts, using prior information to ascertain whether the interpreation holds, or if the blind catalogues problematic in this scenario
