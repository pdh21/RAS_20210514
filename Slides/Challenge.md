## Herschel
### Informative yet confusing
Herschel observations have been key for understanding extragalactic starformation
* starformation occurs in dense gas clouds containing dust
* redshifting of dust emission
* over 1270 deg.$^2$ coverage
* No planned successor

Note:
* about half of starlight is absorbed by dust, radiating at infrared wavelengths
* redshift
* mix of depths, small, deep fields, large and shallow providing better statistics on rare objects to test galaxy formation scenarios in more detail.
* with no planned successor in fir, we are going to have to rely on Herschel for FIR.

### Assigning flux to sources

|      | Blind                          | Prior driven                       |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pros | Detects all bright sources     | Distributes flux to known galaxies |
| Cons | Need to assign flux to sources | Miss unknown sources               |

Note:
* Normal source extraction won't work
* Don't know what or how much source contributes to FIR blob
* Solution is to do list driven approach
* use prior information to build data model, infer model on maps


### Data Products = Data Model
Wrong model = wrong results = wrong interpretation


### Extreme Starformation?
